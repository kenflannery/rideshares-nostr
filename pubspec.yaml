# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  assets:
    - assets/icon/

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,

flutter_launcher_icons:
  # === Required ===
  # Path to your master high-resolution icon
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"

  # === Platform Generation Flags ===
  android: true # Generate Android icons
  ios: true     # Generate iOS icons
  web:
    generate: true # Generate icons for web (manifest.json, icons folder)
    image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png" # Optional: Use same or different icon for web PWA
    background_color: "#C7B2F8" # Optional: Background for PWA splash/tile
    theme_color: "#C7B2F8" # Optional: Theme color for PWA
  windows:
    generate: false # Set to true if you target Windows
    # image_path: ...
    # icon_size: 48 # Optional
  macos:
    generate: false # Set to true if you target macOS
    # image_path: ...

  # === Android Specifics (Recommended) ===
  # For modern Android adaptive icons (required for Android 8.0+)
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FFFFFF" # Color for the background layer (e.g., white) OR path to an asset: "assets/icon/adaptive_bg.png"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/icon/app_icon_foreground.png" # Path to asset for foreground layer (usually your logo with transparency)
  # If you DON'T provide adaptive_icon_foreground, it will use image_path and try to center it.
  # If you DON'T provide adaptive_icon_background, it might default or use a color - explicit is better.

  # === iOS Specifics (Optional) ===
  remove_alpha_ios: true # iOS icons generally shouldn't have transparency
